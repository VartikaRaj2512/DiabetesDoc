DiabetesDoc ðŸ“±ðŸ’¡

DiabetesDoc is a basic mobile application developed during my 2nd year, utilizing C++, Android Studio with Kotlin, and XML. This app estimates whether a patient may have diabetes based on commonly known symptoms. It calculates a score from the user's input to provide predictions, without relying on advanced technologies like Machine Learning.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface ðŸŽ¨: Built with Kotlin and XML, the app provides an intuitive UI for easy navigation and input.
Symptom-Based Prediction ðŸ©º: Uses a scoring system based on user-provided symptoms to estimate the likelihood of diabetes, reflecting a rule-based approach to health assessment.
C++ Integration ðŸ”—: Implements core logic using C++, showcasing versatility and integration skills across different programming languages and platforms.

DiabetesDoc addresses a critical health issue by providing a quick and accessible tool for preliminary diabetes assessment. While basic in design, it demonstrates how traditional programming techniques can be effectively applied in the healthcare domain, highlighting the importance of innovative thinking and practical solutions in the early detection and patient awareness.
